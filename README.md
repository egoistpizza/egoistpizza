### Hi there 👋

I am a freelance developer and cybersecurity expert. 💻   
I'm trying to do my best for the freedom of software and people. ⚖️  
I support IT reform in line with the philosophy of free software. 🐧

I develop and contribute to completely free software. ⌨️  
My only goal is to make people's lives easier and to raise awareness of their rights. ✊🏽

I am interested in developing Python for cybersecurity. 👨‍💻

I am honored to meet and work with people who have the same purpose as me. 🤙

I'd love to chat about anything related to cybersecurity, Python, GNU/Linux, robotics, crypto and IT.
