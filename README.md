### Hello, I’m Yusuf 👋

​As an Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at the Turkish-German University, I focus on **Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science**. My work exists where mathematical theory meets large-scale data to build intelligent systems that are both **computationally efficient and robust**.

​Driven by a passion for **Theoretical Informatics**, my research and projects center on the **design of optimized algorithms and data structures**. Whether building neural networks or developing solutions for autonomous systems, the primary goal remains **algorithmic performance and efficiency**.
