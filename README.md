### Hello, I’m Yusuf 👋

Currently studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at the Turkish-German University specializing in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science**. I work where mathematical theory meets large-scale data to build intelligent systems that are both computationally efficient and robust.

​My work is driven by a passion for **Theoretical Informatics**, particularly the design of **optimized algorithms and data structures**. Whether I’m building neural networks or developing solutions for autonomous systems, I always prioritize algorithmic **performance and efficiency**.
