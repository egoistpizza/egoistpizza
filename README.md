### Hello, I’m Yusuf 👋

Currently studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering at the Turkish-German University, I specialize in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science**. My work exists where mathematical theory meets large-scale data to build intelligent systems that are both computationally **efficient and robust**.

​Driven by a passion for **Theoretical Informatics**, I focus on the design of **optimized algorithms and data structures**. Whether I’m building neural networks or developing solutions for autonomous systems, I always prioritize algorithmic **performance and efficiency**.
