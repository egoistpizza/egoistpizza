### Hi there 👋

I am a freelance developer and cybersecurity enthusiast. 💻                              
I try to develop and contribute to FOSS software as much as I can. 🔧                                   
I am improving myself on machine learning and AI. 🤖

I believe that the widespread use of free software will provide great convenience. 🌟                            
I'm a GNU/Linux user and enthusiast. 🐧

I am interested in developing Python. 👨‍💻                                    
I'd be glad to meet and work with people who have the same purpose as me. 🤙                     
I'd love to chat about anything related to cybersecurity, Python, GNU/Linux, robotics, blockchain, AI, machine learning, aerodynamics, aerial robotics, electronics and more... 💬
